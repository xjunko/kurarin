## Releases
You can get the latest development build from the CI/CD
[here](https://github.com/xjunko/kurarin/releases/tag/latest).

## Running

```bash
./kurarin [...arguments]
```

## Settings

The program will create a `settings.json` file on startup for the first time, and exit right after. <br/>
The next startup will be normal.

## Features

Currently supports:

- Gameplay
- Auto (+ cursordance)
- Rendering (Requires [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to be installed in `$PATH`)
- Storyboard
- Replay (`.osr`) support

Currently does not support:

- Stupid/Aspire maps, the program will either OOM your system or straight up crash, beware.

## Building

### Requirements

- V
- GCC/Clang
- OpenGL 3
- GNU make

#### Linux

Tested with Arch but it _should_ work anywhere else as long as it's linux.

On the root folder of the project, run:
```
make
```

That's it :D
